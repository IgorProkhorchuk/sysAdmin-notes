RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5 but offers extra redundancy by using two parity blocks instead of one. This allows RAID 6 to withstand the failure of up to **two disks**, making it more fault-tolerant than RAID 5. However, the additional parity means it requires at least **four disks** and has slightly reduced write performance compared to RAID 5 due to the extra parity calculations.

Here are some example tasks for RAID 6 using VirtualBox and Debian 12:

---

### **Task 1: Set Up a RAID 6 Array**

#### 1.1. **Create a RAID 6 Array**
Objective: Combine four or more disks into a RAID 6 array, offering fault tolerance with double parity.

1. **Prepare your virtual environment** by adding at least **four virtual hard drives** in VirtualBox, similar to the setup for RAID 5.

2. **List your new disks** to ensure they are visible:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   You should see something like `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, `/dev/sdd`, `/dev/sde`.

3. **Create the RAID 6 array** using `mdadm`:
   ```bash
   sudo mdadm --create /dev/md6 --level=6 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd /dev/sde
   ```

   - `--level=6` specifies RAID 6.
   - Replace `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, etc., with the actual names of your drives.

4. **Monitor the RAID creation process**:
   RAID 6 creation can take some time depending on the disk size. To monitor progress:
   ```bash
   cat /proc/mdstat
   ```

5. **Format the RAID 6 array** with a file system (e.g., ext4):
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md6
   ```

6. **Mount the RAID array**:
   - Create a mount point:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /mnt/raid6
     ```
   - Mount the array:
     ```bash
     sudo mount /dev/md6 /mnt/raid6
     ```

7. **Verify the mount**:
   Check if the RAID 6 array is mounted:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

#### 1.2. **Task**: Test Disk Performance
Objective: Compare the performance of the RAID 6 array to RAID 5 and individual disks.

1. **Write a test file** to the RAID 6 array:
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/raid6/testfile bs=1M count=1000
   ```

2. **Measure the read/write speed** of the RAID 6 array:
   ```bash
   sudo hdparm -t /dev/md6
   ```

---

### **Task 2: Simulate Disk Failures in RAID 6**

RAID 6 can tolerate up to **two simultaneous disk failures** and still function. Let’s simulate two disk failures and then recover the array.

#### 2.1. **Simulate Two Disk Failures**
Objective: Remove two disks from the RAID array and observe how the array handles the failure.

1. **Fail one of the disks** (e.g., `/dev/sdb`):
   ```bash
   sudo mdadm /dev/md6 --fail /dev/sdb --remove /dev/sdb
   ```

2. **Fail a second disk** (e.g., `/dev/sdc`):
   ```bash
   sudo mdadm /dev/md6 --fail /dev/sdc --remove /dev/sdc
   ```

3. **Check the status of the RAID array**:
   ```bash
   cat /proc/mdstat
   ```
   The array should now show that it is degraded but still operational (since RAID 6 can tolerate two disk failures).

4. **Test if you can still access data**:
   Try accessing files from the mounted RAID array:
   ```bash
   ls /mnt/raid6
   ```

#### 2.2. **Task**: Rebuild the Array After Disk Failures
Objective: Replace the failed disks and rebuild the RAID 6 array to restore redundancy.

1. **Add new disks** (or re-add the same ones after "replacing" them) to the array:
   ```bash
   sudo mdadm /dev/md6 --add /dev/sdb
   sudo mdadm /dev/md6 --add /dev/sdc
   ```

2. **Monitor the rebuilding process**:
   ```bash
   watch cat /proc/mdstat
   ```

   The RAID array will rebuild the missing data onto the new disks. This process can take time depending on the size of the disks.

3. **Check the RAID status** after the rebuild:
   ```bash
   sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md6
   ```

   The array should now be healthy again.

---

### **Task 3: Configure RAID 6 for Auto-Assembly on Boot**

You want your RAID 6 array to automatically assemble and mount at boot.

#### 3.1. **Configure Auto-Assembly**

1. **Add the RAID array to `mdadm` configuration**:
   Update the configuration so the system will auto-detect the RAID array during boot.
   ```bash
   sudo mdadm --detail --scan | sudo tee -a /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
   ```

2. **Update the initramfs**:
   Ensure the boot process knows about the RAID array by updating the initramfs:
   ```bash
   sudo update-initramfs -u
   ```

#### 3.2. **Automatically Mount the RAID Array**

1. **Edit the `/etc/fstab` file** to ensure the array is mounted at boot:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

2. **Add a new line** for the RAID array:
   ```bash
   /dev/md6  /mnt/raid6  ext4  defaults  0  0
   ```

3. **Test the `fstab` entry**:
   Unmount the array and test if it mounts correctly from `/etc/fstab`:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /mnt/raid6
   sudo mount -a
   ```

---

### **Task 4: Monitor RAID 6 Health**

You should continuously monitor the health of your RAID 6 array to catch issues early.

#### 4.1. **Set Up Monitoring**
Objective: Configure automatic monitoring of the RAID array with email alerts.

1. **Reconfigure `mdadm` to send email notifications** in case of disk failure or degradation:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg-reconfigure mdadm
   ```

2. **Verify the `mdadm.conf` configuration** file has the correct email address set for notifications:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
   ```
   Look for the `MAILADDR` line and ensure it has your correct email address:
   ```bash
   MAILADDR your_email@example.com
   ```

3. **Restart the `mdadm` monitoring service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mdadm
   ```

4. **Check RAID status manually**:
   Use `mdadm` to get a detailed report of your RAID array’s status:
   ```bash
   sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md6
   ```

#### 4.2. **Task**: Simulate Monitoring Notification
Simulate a disk failure to test if the monitoring system sends you a notification.

```bash
sudo mdadm /dev/md6 --fail /dev/sdb --remove /dev/sdb
```

- After the failure, check if the email notification is sent.
- Re-add the disk and monitor the rebuild process.

### **Task 5: Expand the RAID 6 Array**

RAID 6 allows you to add more disks and expand the array without losing data.

#### 5.1. **Expand the Array by Adding a New Disk**
Objective: Add a new disk to the RAID 6 array and grow the filesystem.

1. **Add another virtual disk** to your VirtualBox Debian VM (e.g., `/dev/sdf`).

2. **Add the new disk to the RAID array**:
   ```bash
   sudo mdadm --add /dev/md6 /dev/sdf
   ```

3. **Grow the RAID array** to include the new disk:
   ```bash
   sudo mdadm --grow /dev/md6 --raid-devices=5
   ```

4. **Resize the filesystem** to use the new space:
   ```bash
   sudo resize2fs /dev/md6
   ```

5. **Verify the expansion**:
   Check the disk space available after adding the new disk:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

---

### **Task 6: Benchmark RAID 6 Performance**

Objective: Compare RAID 6 performance with RAID 5 and other RAID levels.

1. **Benchmark read/write performance**:
   Write a test file to the RAID 6 array and measure the performance:
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/raid6/testfile bs=1M count=1000
   ```

2. **Measure the time taken for file operations** and compare the performance of RAID 6 against other RAID levels like RAID 5 and RAID 1 (from your previous tasks).

---

### **Conclusion**:
RAID 6 provides increased fault tolerance with dual parity, making it highly resilient to disk failures. These tasks will give you hands-on
