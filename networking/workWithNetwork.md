Here’s a list of commonly used Linux commands and tools for working with networks, ranging from network configuration and diagnostics to monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 1. **Network Configuration Commands**

   - **`ip`**: Configures and shows network interface parameters.
     ```bash
     ip addr show           # Display IP addresses of interfaces
     ip link set eth0 up    # Bring an interface up
     ```
   - **`ifconfig`**: Legacy command for configuring network interfaces.
   - **`route`**: Shows and manipulates the IP routing table.
     ```bash
     route -n               # Display current routing table
     ```
   - **`nmcli`**: Manages NetworkManager, useful on modern Linux systems for configuring connections.
     ```bash
     nmcli device show      # Show all network interfaces
     ```
   - **`dhclient`**: Configures network interfaces using DHCP.
     ```bash
     sudo dhclient eth0     # Obtain an IP address via DHCP for eth0
     ```
   - **`iptables`/`nftables`**: Sets up, configures, and manages firewall rules.

### 2. **Network Diagnostics and Troubleshooting**

   - **`ping`**: Checks the connectivity to a host by sending ICMP packets.
     ```bash
     ping example.com
     ```
   - **`traceroute`**: Traces the route packets take to a network host.
     ```bash
     traceroute example.com
     ```
   - **`tracepath`**: Similar to `traceroute` but doesn’t require root permissions.
   - **`mtr`**: Combines `ping` and `traceroute` for continuous network diagnostics.
     ```bash
     mtr example.com
     ```
   - **`netstat`**: Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc.
     ```bash
     netstat -tuln         # Show listening TCP/UDP ports
     ```
   - **`ss`**: Newer tool that replaces `netstat`, showing socket information.
     ```bash
     ss -tuln               # Show listening TCP/UDP ports
     ```
   - **`arp`**: Shows and manipulates the ARP cache.
     ```bash
     arp -a                 # Show the ARP table
     ```
   - **`dig`**: DNS lookup tool that queries DNS servers.
     ```bash
     dig example.com
     ```
   - **`nslookup`**: Another DNS lookup tool.
   - **`host`**: Simple utility for DNS lookups.
     ```bash
     host example.com
     ```
   - **`nc`** (Netcat): Reads and writes data across network connections, versatile for testing.
     ```bash
     nc -zv example.com 80  # Scan port 80
     ```
   - **`telnet`**: Tests connectivity to a specific port.
     ```bash
     telnet example.com 80
     ```

### 3. **Network Monitoring and Analysis**

   - **`tcpdump`**: Captures and analyzes network packets.
     ```bash
     sudo tcpdump -i eth0    # Capture packets on eth0
     ```
   - **`wireshark`**: GUI tool for network packet analysis (requires X server if using remotely).
   - **`iftop`**: Displays bandwidth usage by active connections.
     ```bash
     sudo iftop -i eth0      # Monitor bandwidth on eth0
     ```
   - **`nload`**: Monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic in real-time.
   - **`iptraf-ng`**: Interactive, text-based network monitoring tool.
   - **`bmon`**: Bandwidth monitor that provides a graphical view in the terminal.

### 4. **Network Testing and Performance**

   - **`iperf3`**: Tests network throughput between two hosts.
     ```bash
     iperf3 -s              # Start server on one host
     iperf3 -c <server_ip>  # Connect as a client to server
     ```
   - **`speedtest-cli`**: Runs an internet speed test from the command line.
     ```bash
     speedtest-cli
     ```

### 5. **Security and Scanning**

   - **`nmap`**: Network scanner for discovery, port scanning, and service enumeration.
     ```bash
     nmap example.com
     ```
   - **`netcat`** (or **`nc`**): Also useful for simple port scanning and banner grabbing.
   - **`hping3`**: Network testing tool that sends TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets.
     ```bash
     hping3 -S example.com -p 80  # Test SYN packets on port 80
     ```
   - **`whois`**: Looks up information about domains and IP addresses.
     ```bash
     whois example.com
     ```

### 6. **VPN and Secure Connections**

   - **`ssh`**: Secure Shell for encrypted network connections.
     ```bash
     ssh user@example.com
     ```
   - **`openvpn`**: Open-source VPN software for creating secure tunnels.
   - **`stunnel`**: Adds SSL encryption to network connections.
   - **`socat`**: Versatile utility for establishing bidirectional data transfers over various types of sockets, including TCP and UDP.

### 7. **File Transfer Commands**

   - **`scp`**: Secure file copy over SSH.
     ```bash
     scp file.txt user@example.com:/path/to/destination
     ```
   - **`rsync`**: Synchronizes files and directories between hosts over SSH.
     ```bash
     rsync -av file.txt user@example.com:/path/to/destination
     ```
   - **`ftp`** and **`sftp`**: Command-line FTP clients (SFTP is secure, FTP is not).

### 8. **Miscellaneous Networking Utilities**

   - **`curl`**: Transfers data from or to a server, supporting HTTP, FTP, etc.
     ```bash
     curl http://example.com
     ```
   - **`wget`**: Retrieves files from the web, useful for downloading content.
   - **`ethtool`**: Displays and modifies Ethernet device parameters.
     ```bash
     ethtool eth0
     ```
   - **`iwconfig`**: Configures wireless network interfaces.
     ```bash
     iwconfig wlan0
     ```
   - **`iwlist`**: Scans for available wireless networks.
     ```bash
     iwlist wlan0 scan
     ```

These tools and commands cover most networking tasks in Linux, from basic connectivity checks to detailed packet analysis and performance testing.
